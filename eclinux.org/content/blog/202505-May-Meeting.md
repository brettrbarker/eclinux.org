**Location:** Beachside Community Church

Items discussed:

We explored more of [Over The Wire - CTF](overthewire.org). Over the Wire is a site with "wargames" to help learn different "hacking" subjects. We went through several of the Bandit game which is focused on Linux command line tools. It elevates in difficulty as you progress the levels, and there are different games on the site for different subjects like web exploits.

Another site to take a look at is [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/).
