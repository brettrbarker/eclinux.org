Rust Night!

Aaron gave us an intro to the Rust programming language. Next month we will dive
a little deeper and work on writing some basic code!

```bash
# Get the following executables available on your system, and test as in the following:

rustc --version

cargo --version

# For Arch: 

sudo pacman -S rust

# For Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora: use rustup 

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# For NixOS, just add them to your systemPackages.
```
