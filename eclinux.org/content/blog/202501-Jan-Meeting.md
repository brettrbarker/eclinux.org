## Business Items

**Next Meeting:** February 17, 2024 @6PM

**Location:** Beachside Community Church

* * *

Thank you all for coming! We had a good crowd.

Items discussed:

* Gary let us attempt a distribution upgrade on his laptop.
* apt update / apt upgrade / do-release-upgrade
* The upgrade "succeeded" from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04, but well... we lost network drivers in the process.
* I am rebuilding at home with 24.04...

Next month we are going to take apart an old light board that runs linux!
