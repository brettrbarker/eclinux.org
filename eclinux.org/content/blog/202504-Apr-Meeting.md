## Business Items

**Next Meeting:** May 19, 2025 @6PM

**Location:** Beachside Community Church

Items discussed:

Kevin brought in his [FireBat](https://www.amazon.com/FIREBAT-1000MHz-Desktop-Computer-Business/dp/B0DNB5F2N8) mini PC that we looked at and installed Ubuntu and then ProxMox on.

We also finally got Gary's e-Sword Windows application working with WINE on Ubuntu 24.04 for him.
The trick was also installing Windows Media Player using WineTricks using the command "winetricks -q wmp11".
Perhaps, not the best idea to install old Windows Media Player... but that's a different discussion.

Hope to see you all next month. Bring your topic ideas or send us a message on
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#eclinux:matrix.org), and we can plan ahead!
