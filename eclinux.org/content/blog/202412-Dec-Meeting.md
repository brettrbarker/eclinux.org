Thank you all for coming. Aaron showed us some new NixOS tricks around creating dev environments with NixOS flakes.

We also briefly talked about the following:

* [ReactOS](https://reactos.org/) - Possible solution to running Windows apps in a VM
* [Open Nebula](https://opennebula.io/) - VMware alternative
* [Atari VCS](https://atari.com/pages/atari-vcs) - Kevin's new toy

It was a very educational evening. Thank you all for hanging out! See you in January.
