**Location:** Beachside Community Church

Thank you all for coming! We had a good crowd.

Items discussed:

Took a basic look at LLMs. This is definitely a topic that we
should revisit in the future. A homework video to watch is this 
one by 3Blue1Brown: [Transformers (how LLMs work) explained visually | DL5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M)

Other LLM resources we looked at:

- [Google's NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)
- [Llama](https://www.llama.com/)

Brett also gave a basic overview of some of the Applied Cryptography
that he has been learning in his master's class. Basics of Indistinguishability
Under Chosen Plaintext Attacks (IND-CPA), Indistinguishability Under Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (IND-CCA),
and Unforgeability Under Chosen-Message Attacks (UF-CMA) among other things.
Here is a quick video about IND-CPA and IND-CCA security:

Hope to see you all next month. Bring your topic ideas or send us a message on
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#eclinux:matrix.org), and we can plan ahead!
